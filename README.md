Hello and welcome to my Day Planner

I used bootstrap to build the framework and moment.js to be able to get the date. I was able to get the info to save by setting it to the local storage and retrieve it from the same local storage

## Description
I have created an app that can be used as a daily work planner. This app will allow you to input information in and save this information. As the time through out the day continues to the change, so will your app, as it will indicate the current hour and a certain color for past and future hours. Everyday this app will refresh allowing for you to use it over and over!
